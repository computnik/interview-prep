## Infix to Postfix

#### Infix expression:

The expression of the form `a op b`. When an operator is in-between every pair of operands.

#### Postfix expression:

The expression of the form `a b op`. When an operator is followed for every pair of operands.

#### Why postfix representation of the expression?

The compiler scans the expression either from left to right or from right to left. Consider the below
expression: `a op1 b op2 c op3 d`
If `op1 = +`, `op2 = *`, `op3 = +`
The compiler first scans the expression to evaluate the expression `b * c`, then again scans the expression to `add a`
to it. The result is then `added to d` after another scan. The repeated scanning makes it very **in-efficient**. It is
better to convert the expression to `postfix(or prefix)` form before evaluation. The corresponding expression in postfix
form is `abc*+d+`. The postfix expressions can be evaluated easily using a **stack**.

### Algorithm

1. Scan the infix expression from `left` to `right`.
2. If the scanned character is an `operand`, output it.
3. Else,
4. If the precedence of the scanned operator is greater than the precedence of the operator in the stack(or the
   stack is empty, or the stack contains a `'('` ), push it.
5. Else, Pop all the operators from the stack which are greater than or equal to in precedence than that of the
   scanned operator. After doing that Push the scanned operator to the stack. (If you encounter parenthesis while
   popping then stop there and push the scanned operator in the stack.)
6. If the scanned character is an `'('`, push it to the stack.
7. If the scanned character is an `')â€™`, pop the stack and output it until a `'('` is encountered, and discard both the
   parenthesis.
8. Repeat steps `2-6` until `infix` expression is scanned.
9. `Print` the output
10. Pop and output from the stack until it is not empty.
